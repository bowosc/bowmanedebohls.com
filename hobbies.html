                Sailing
            </div>
            <div class="pp-main">
                I learned the basics of sailing in my freshman year of high school, and was immediately hooked. 
                By my senior year, I was the captain of my high school's varsity team, sailing FJs and Lasers
                in the Puget Sound of Seattle. 
                <br><br>
                In high school, I sailed with the Corinthian Yacht Club in Ballard, and instructed youth sailing courses there in the 
                summer of 2024 after working as an assistant instructor in 2022.

                Server Management
            </div>
            <div class="pp-main">
                Beyond my experience coding, I've also done a good amount of work administrating servers. I've never been paid
                for this work, but I have a surprising amount of fun doing it.
                <br><br>
                I've spent probably hundreds of hours setting up, configuring, and managing Minecraft servers, for groups of friends
                as well as for my high school's official server. I'm currently working with Cal Poly ASI to produce and administrate
                the backend for the hosting of a series of Minecraft-based events for Cal Poly Housing.
                <br><br>
                I've hosted servers with laptop a raspberry pi in the past, but now run these 
                primarily through various Oracle cloud services, fiddling with virtual machines on Ubuntu or Oracle Linux.
