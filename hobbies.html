            </div>
            <div class="pp-main">
                In high school, I sailed at the Corinthian Yacht Club in Ballard, WA. I was the captain of my high school's varsity sailing team.
                Over the summer of 2024, I instructed youth sailing courses after working as an assistant instructor in 2022. 
                <br><br>
                I'm hoping to sail more here at Cal Poly, but haven't yet had the chance due to practices conflicting with my schedule.
                <br><br>
                I mostly sail FJs, but I also love to sail in V15s, 420s, and Lasers when given the chance.

                Beyond my experience coding, I've also done a good amount of work administrating servers. 
                <br><br>
                I've spent probably hundreds of hours setting up, managing, and doing upkeep on various Minecraft servers. I've managed
                servers for groups of friends as well as my high school's official server. 
                Currently, I am working with Cal Poly ASI to organize and manage a series of Minecraft-based events for Cal Poly Housing. 
                This will include setup, scaling for peak usage and ongoing maintenance to ensure smooth operation.
                <br><br>
                I host these servers on Oracle Cloud infrastructure now, but in the past I've hosted both Minecraft and traditional webservers on a Raspberry Pi, dedicated game hosting, and once my own laptop.

                I play the popular card game Magic: The Gathering (a little too much). I spend most of my time playing EDH, brewing Modern, losing at Oathbreaker, and drafting my Cube.
                <br><br>
                I'm a certified Level 1 Tournament Judge, meaning that I oversee events and manage the complicated rules & policy interactions that occur in tournament gameplay.
                I've worked at several events in the greater Seattle area, including two ComicCons and a $20K RCQ / ReCQ at MXP Tacoma. 
                (MXP had over 400 players in each RCQ / ReCQ!).
                <br><br>
                Iâ€™ve also competed in regional and subregional tournaments, and have two top 8 (and one top 16) placements in Modern Regional Championship Qualifiers.
