                I'm currently working on the Astromech project with the Cal Poly Robotics Club.
                We're building an R2-D2-like robot (named Pascal) from the ground up, including subsystems such as a speaker
                system, display screens, and a T-shirt cannon.
                <br><br>
                I work on the electrical team, most of my work consists of helping to design and assemble the custom circuitboards and electrical system
                in the head, which is electrically seperate from the body. These boards consist of three large panels, together forming a ring lining the inside of the dome. 
                <br><br>
                Our goals with this project include the ability to bring Pascal to sports games and use the T-shirt cannon to arouse some hype. Beyond this, a long-term goal
                is total autonomy, in which Pascal would be able to find his way around campus with no outside control.

                ConstAnt is a near-finished project centered around the idea of a search engine that enables a user 
                to search a mathematical expression by the result, kind of like a reverse calculator. 
                <br><br>
                The data, thousands of numbers (constants), is initially generated automatically. 
                From here, users have the ability to add their own constants to the database. Users can
                also like and comment under other's constants, creating a set of useful "trivia" pertaining to
                each of the many constants searchable on the site. The final result here will be a wide database of 
                numbers and their properties, trivia, and arithmatic relationships with other numbers.
                <br><br>
                ConstAnt uses a Flask backend with a lot of SQLAlchemy ORM.

                San Juan Errands is a food delivery scheduling website that takes user orders, manages accounts, and updates a delivery interface.
                This project was set up primarily using Flask and SQLAlchemy. 
                <br><br>
                This website utilizes features such as order tracking for both the customer and the deliveryperson, functional 
                control panels, basic password security, and secure, encrypted token-based email confirmation. 
                <br><br>
                The San Juan Errands business is centered around the idea of an errands & food delivery business on San Juan Island, WA, where my family has a lot of history.
                This kind of service is rare in the area, with no Doordash or Grubhub presence of any kind, which leaves a perfect spot for this business.

                SoundBo is a minimalistic, customizable soundbar for the MacOS menu bar.
                <br><br>
                I created SoundBo with the goal of achieving the minimal possible time between thought and sound. 
                In addition to short sound effects, it can also function as a solid music library.
                With a clear and straightforward user experience, SoundBo includes featues such as the ability to add, remove, and name sounds. 
                <br><br>
                SoundBo uses the rumps library to interact with the menu bar, pygame for sound mixing, and tkinter for the file dialog windows. It's very compact, both in storage space and in GUI.
