            <div class="pp-main">
                I'm a member of the Cal Poly Robotics Club, where I'm currently working on the Astromech project.
                We're building an R2-D2-like robot from the ground up, including subsystems such as a speaker
                system, an electrically seperate head, and a T-shirt cannon! 
                <br><br>
                I work on the electrical subteam of this project, and so far have done most of my work on the custom circuitboards
                in the head. These consist of three large panels, together forming a ring lining the inside of the dome. 
                Our goal here is total autonomy, and we're getting quite close - just need to finish off a couple subsystems 
                and some software.

                FridayDelivery
            </div>
            <div class="pp-main">
                FridayDelivery is a personal project I worked on in early 2024, was the functional structure of a website where 
                users can schedule food delivery. FridayDelivery was set up primarily using Python, with Flask and SQLAlchemy taking major roles. 
                <br><br>It was created in the context of a business class I took, in which a business plan is 
                iterated upon and mapped out over the course of a semester. The business,
                San Juan Errands, consisted of food delivery and errand running in a geographically restricted area (San Juan Island).
                <br><br>This website utilizes features such as order tracking for both the customer and the deliveryperson, functional 
                control panels, email confirmation, basic password cybersecurity, and encrypted, SMTP-based account verification.

                ConstAnt
            </div>
            <div class="pp-main">
                ConstAnt is an almost-finished project centered around the idea of a web-based search engine that allows you 
                to search a math expression by the result. ConstAnt uses a Python backend with a lot of SQLAlchemy ORM and Flask for the frontend.
                <br><br>
                Let's say I'm having a hard time evaluating an integral, so I just put the thing in a calculator: -18.330215. 
                I've got no idea what this means, so I search it with ConstAnt! ConstAnt finds my
                answer right away: sqrt(e^pi) - sqrt(e^2pi). I'm constantly revamping the algorithms to achieve a more efficient & 
                complete data set as well as efficient searching, which has actually been a lot of fun. 
                <br><br>
                I'm working to maximize the potential goofiness of ConstAnt, through features such as allowing users to upload their own constants,
                name their own constants, and like / comment on others' constants.
