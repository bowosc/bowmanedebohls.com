                I'm currently working on the Astromech project with the Cal Poly Robotics Club.
                We're building an R2-D2-like robot (named Pascal) from the ground up, including subsystems such as a speaker
                system, display screens, and a T-shirt cannon.
                <br><br>
                I work on the electrical team, and so far have done most of my work helping to design and assemble the custom circuitboards and electrical system
                in the head, which is electrically seperate from the body. These boards consist of three large panels, together forming a ring lining the inside of the dome. 
                <br><br>
                Our goals with this project include the ability to bring Pascal to sports games, and use the T-shirt cannon to arouse some hype. Beyond this, our long-term goal
                is total autonomy, in which Pascal would find his way around campus with no outside control.

                San Juan Errands is a food delivery scheduling website that takes user orders, manages accounts, and updates a delivery interface.
                This project was set up primarily using Python, with Flask and SQLAlchemy taking major roles. 
                <br><br>
                This website utilizes features such as order tracking for both the customer and the deliveryperson, functional 
                control panels, basic password security, and secure, encrypted token-based email confirmation. 
                <br><br>
                The San Juan Errands business is centered around the idea of an errands & food delivery business on San Juan Island, WA, where my family has a lot of history.
                This kind of service is rare in the area, with no Doordash or Grubhub presence of any kind, which leaves a perfect spot for this business.

                ConstAnt is a near-finished project centered around the idea of a search engine that enables a user 
                to search a mathematical expression by the result, kind of like a reverse calculator. 
                <br><br>
                The data, thousands of numbers (constants), is initially generated by a script that's run by the site on boot. 
                From here, users have the ability to post (and name) their own constants, making sure any gaps in the set are filled. Users can
                also like and comment under other's constants, with an algorithm hiding less-common constants while those more likely to be useful float to the top.
                <br><br>
                ConstAnt uses a Python backend with a lot of SQLAlchemy ORM, running on a Flask site. A lot of the work here is in the data-gen and searching algorithms.
